# FMI
FMI is Fine-dust Measuring Instrument application.
<br><br>
This project is very simple. The fine dust level at the current location or a specific location set by Google Maps displays data obtained through IQAir's open API on the screen.

This project is only for me to practice developing Android apps. I developed based on the following technology.
- AAC
- Repository
- Retrofit
- ViewModel
- Google Map

The referenced project is very simple in structure and security, so there are many problems. I have improved the structure and improved what will be a security problem to address those problems.
